# amlytheme README

amlytheme is a vscode extension that provides syntax highlighting to a custom data format

## installing

use git/github to clone the repo, have the local path be (user root)/.vscode/extensions<br>
to update the extension pull changes from the repo then restart your vscode instance<br><br>

if you don't know how to do that then why are you here? I would say go to the extension marketplace but I can't be bothered to go through the steps especially since I would need to create a microsoft account which I don't want to do so deal with it
